No longer in development.

This repo is based on a series of Youtube videos going in depth on what a larger golang codebase might look like. In the process I got a lot of practice with docker, kubernetes, and golang as well as learning a bit more about database deadlock scenarios with Postgres.

At this point I have learned what I needed and I might come back to this, but at the moment I am focusing on learning more low level stuff.
